# Text-to-Speech-Converter
## This is a Text to Speech Converter, it's another useful language learning tool when attempting to figure out the correct pronouncination of words. As an Irish person learning German it was a fun way to hear how words are pronounced in a robotic/standard dialect. The project was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript utilising Windows languages/speech libraries.
